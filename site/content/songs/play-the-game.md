This is the first song that I ever wrote about my wife, Mary.  We like playing games it is one of the things that we like doing together besides just hanging out.  She is the first person that I have ever met that has the same temperament as myself.  When I first told some of my friends about Mary they would ask me what is she like?  I would reply that she is just like me except she is a woman.

The song itself has a very playful feel to it. Parts of it feel kind of beachy like in the Caribbean.  For about 4 years in a row before the Pandemic we would spend about a week out in those beaches as we went on an annual Vegan Cruise.

I had a lot of fun writing and recording this song.  It is just a nice feel good song and hope you enjoy this song as much as I did in creating it.  Play the game is now streaming from all the streaming platforms.  I have a spotify embedded player for your convenience.  Thanks again for listening and being a fan.

**2023-05-13 Update:** I just received a very nice review from Radio Airplay that I just had to share with you all.  It also serves as a place where I can find it myself.

**2023-07-19 Update:** Because not everyone might be on Spotify, I have a new launcher that pops up to launch the song on several of the most popular platforms out there.  This includes Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Amazon Music, YouTube, Tidal, and Deezer.  Let me know in the comments if there are other streaming platforms that you would like to see included here.  Just click on the Stream Now button to reveal the launcher.
