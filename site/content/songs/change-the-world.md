First off this is not a song that I wrote.  It was written by **Tommy Sims, Gordon Kennedy and Wayne Kirkpatrick**.  It was originally recorded by **Wynonna Judd** and released in **1996** on her **Revelations** album but she never released this as a single.  The song was recorded by **Eric Clapton** and produced by **Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds** for the **1996** movie **"Phenomenon"**.  Eric Clapton also released this song on his **1999 Clapton Chronicles: The Best of Eric Clapton** album which is the one you will find on Spotify.

This was not one of those songs written in 20 minutes during a recording session.  The three songwriters that wrote this song worked on it for over a year.  I recorded a version of this song putting a bit of my own spin on it by giving it a bit of a hip-hop rhythm.  

My reasons for recording this and including it into my catalog of songs was the message of hope.  If I could change the world what could that look like?  We are all capable of making changes and even influence change in others.  If you think what can I do? I am only one person.  Think about that one mosquito in a dark bedroom when you are trying to sleep.

**Change the World** is now available on all the streaming platforms. Below is a launcher for the song on several streaming platforms.  Choose your favorite streaming platform and enjoy.
