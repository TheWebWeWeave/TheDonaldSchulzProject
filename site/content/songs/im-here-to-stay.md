This is a declaration of my intentions to stay in my new found home in California.  When I first moved to California for work, my original intention was to stay here for a couple of years and then go back to Canada.  However, since then things really changed for me.  I met Mary and it was like suddenly the person I had been looking for all my life was right here in the land that I loved to visit and have always been drawn to.

Mary and I got married on a sandy beach in Malibu California with most of my immediate family and a few of our closest friends from work.  My plans have changed and I am just fine with that.  I have wanted to live in southern California ever since the first time that my family visited this piece of paradise.

This song will take you on a journey of the things that I am leaving behind.  Canada is a beautiful place but it has many hardships as well that you cannot ignore.  The chorus centers around the declaration that I am here in my new home with no intention what so ever of moving back to Canada.  I do miss my siblings, nephews, niece, cousins, and of course my mom.  I don't get to visit as often as I like but this is where I am going to stay.
