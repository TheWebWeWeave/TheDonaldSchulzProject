This music was performed for the first time at my Mom and Dad's 25th Wedding Anniversary.  Several years later I rearranged the music and recording this in a 24 track studio in Edmonton, Alberta with some friends and some additional professional musicians.  This became a very limited release and one of the last things that I pressed into a vinyl record.  The music centers around a good cup of coffee. One of the signs that indicated to us as kids that company was coming was sound of the very loud percolator that would be whooshing away making that hot cup of java.

My parents loved to entertain guests, especially my Dad and that always included coffee.  This music is all about the making of that beverage.  In fact I even recorded my Mom's percolator as it went to work and included it in the recording.  Less than a month later that machine died and by then everyone was switching to coffee drip machines.  Which are a whole lot less interesting to listen to, too quiet.

Recently I got the original 24 tracks converted to digital stems and rebuilt the music with a lot of new cuts of instruments and included a few of the original tracks to make this new recording.  Giving it a more up to date sound but the feel is pretty much the same.  This music pairs very nicely with a good old cup of coffee.

For your convenience I have an embedded player streaming from Spotify.  The song is available on all the streaming platforms so no matter where you get your streaming music from you should be able to find it there.
