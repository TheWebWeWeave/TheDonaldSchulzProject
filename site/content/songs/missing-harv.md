Have you ever had something that you put off for a long, long, time until it was too late?  That is what this song is all about.  Working on this collection of songs, caused me to think about my musical taste and why I was so drawn to the genre's I was drawn to.  I have as long as I can remember been drawn to rock, blues or funk bands that had a decent brass section.  Bands like Chicago, Blood Sweat and Tears, Tower of Power, and of course Lighthouse.  This all came about because I wanted a cousin that I was very close to at one time, to be part of the band I was putting together.

I remember being at his house and he was playing records from Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass.  In the beginning he would work out a part and I would notate it.  I was always good at music notation and writing out the arrangement.  From there I learned how to put brass arrangements together, read books, went to McEwan University's music program for a year, but this is where it all started from.  To make sure my cousin had a place in my band.

The band broke up because we were pursuing other interests.  I didn't want to play live gigs anymore and wanted to concentrate more on producing, writing, and studio work.  My cousin got busy with getting his Commerce Degree and built a career in the telephone field, and start a family.  We were so close once, and we weren't upset with each other, we just went in different directions.

Even my own path took me in directions that I had not anticipated.  I went back to my home town to work in my family business as an account, but even before that I took some night courses with a friend of mine on the various aspects of the printing field.  I figured that these would be good skills to have as when I produce a record I would be able to communicate my album art desires in the same language that they understood.  I even got a job first as a sales person, selling printing services, then layout, camera work, preparing the plates, and then finally printing.  The shop I was working in they just received a brand new bigger press and a few weeks later the only other printer, left.  Now I was the printer.

Anyway, back to the family business.  I came back twice with a two year break in between them where I went back to the city and started a printing and promotion company.  The second time I came back I get heavily involved in computers and built some of the software that we were using.  In the beginning I was working really long days and most weekends just to keep up.  With the software that I modified I picked up a bunch of cheap computers and linked them all up using Lantastic and got the entry of the data at the point of sale (POS).  Once I did that I could get all my work done in a total of 10 days.  I would start working five days before the end of the month and be done five days after the month.  Then I would go on a three week vacation.  After three months, my Father informed me that they did not need me anymore.  Which was fine by me because I was bored with the accounting side but really loved the programming side.

I went back to McEwan University but this time for their Micro Computer program.  After three years after I graduated I landed a job in California.  This always was a dream of mine to live here but I always thought that the music would get me here.  Nope, it was the technology.  Anyway, this cousin and I never spoke or connected with each other.  There was no reason not to call and get together with him and it really hit me like a ton of bricks when my Mother informed me that he had died.  No one knew that he had cancer, and he died in Hospice.  There was no way to let him know how much I appreciated him.  I don't regret the road I took and I still love that style of music as I am sure you can hear that in many of my songs.
