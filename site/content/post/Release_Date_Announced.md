We will be releasing our first single "Hot Java" on February 24, 2023.  It should be available on all your favorite streaming services, where ever you get your music from.  I am hoping for some good numbers here and hope that you will help us to get the word out.  Hot Java is an instrumental and even though I have put this in the jazz and blues genre, it has a lot of elements of pop and rock, very fusion.  This is not hard core jazz, this is fun jazz and hopefully it will be your go to song when you are enjoying a nice cup of Hot Java.

I do have an interesting back story about this song which you will find under the Songs menu.  Thanks for your support and a for being a fan.
