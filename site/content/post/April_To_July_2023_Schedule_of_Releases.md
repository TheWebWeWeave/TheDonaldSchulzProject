Instead of coming out with an album is about 4 months I am going to be doing regular releases roughly about every two weeks.  I am still planning to package a number of these songs into the album that I had planned but this way you get to ride along with me as I get the pieces put together.  As a result I even have a rough schedule of the dates and which song will be released at that time.

Don't forget to signup for my newsletter where you can get early access to the songs before the release date.  You will get access to them as soon as the mastering process has been completed and uploaded into my private area waiting for the distribution date.
