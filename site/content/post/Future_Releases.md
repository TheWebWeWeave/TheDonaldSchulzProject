I thought I would give you all some updates about what is going on with The Donald Schulz Project.  I am currently working on 4 more songs that I want to put together in the form of an album which will be called "Finding my Voice".  It really marks the trail that I took to be able to truthfully express what I was feeling with words.  I have always been a person that was in touch with my feelings but they came out in the music that I played.  My music was my emotions coming out.  Sometimes I wrote lyrics but in many cases they were just words without much depth.  That depth started coming out when I worked on "Always on my Mind" and I worked for years on that song and even recorded some demos of it along the way.

## What changed?

"Always on my Mind" was a game changer for me as it was a git of a confessional of how I was feeling when I was truly in love and that relationship just ended.  It was a bit crazy as I knew there was an expiry date right from the start, but somehow my heart had other ideas.  This was the spring board to a lot of changes in my life.  I moved back home to work in the family business for a while.  I did continue to try a few more projects but things were different and I felt it wasn't my time anymore.

From the family business to a couple of years of doing some interesting promotions work.  I went back to the family business which helped to open me up to computers and technology.  This took me back to college and from there started a very successful career in technology that eventually landed me in Los Angeles, California.  This move was the start of the biggest change in my life as I met the woman who became my wife.  

Being married and with some help of some therapy I had to learn how to express into words what I was feeling.  I could no long bottle up these emotions and process them through playing.  My wife wants to know what is going on with me.

## Finding my Voice
This collection of songs is really about that journey.  These songs are about me and the songs written by me are things that are very personal to me.
