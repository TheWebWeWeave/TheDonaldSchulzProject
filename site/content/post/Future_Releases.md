I thought I would give you all some updates about what is going on with The Donald Schulz Project.  I am currently working on 4 more songs that I want to put together in the form of an album which will be called "Finding my Voice".  It really marks the trail that I took to be able to truthfully express what I was feeling with words.  I have always been a person that was in touch with my feelings but they came out in the music that I played.  My music was my emotions coming out.  Sometimes I wrote lyrics but in many cases they were just words without much depth.  That depth started coming out when I worked on "Always on my Mind" and I worked for years on that song and even recorded some demos of it along the way.
