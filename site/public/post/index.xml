      <description>Instead of coming out with an album is about 4 months I am going to be doing regular releases roughly about every two weeks. I am still planning to package a number of these songs into the album that I had planned but this way you get to ride along with me as I get the pieces put together. As a result I even have a rough schedule of the dates and which song will be released at that time.</description>

      <description>We will be releasing our first single &amp;ldquo;Hot Java&amp;rdquo; on February 24, 2023. It should be available on all your favorite streaming services, where ever you get your music from. I am hoping for some good numbers here and hope that you will help us to get the word out. Hot Java is an instrumental and even though I have put this in the jazz and blues genre, it has a lot of elements of pop and rock, very fusion.</description>
